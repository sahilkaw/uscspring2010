Delay (latentcy): secs
	deterministic (equation to plug in and calculate)
		Transmission Time = length of msg (bits)/Bit (data) rate (bps)
			is the time elapsed from the time you transmit the first bit of the message til the time you transmit the last bit of message.
		Propogation delay = length of the link(m) / speed of propogation(m/s)
			speed of propogation is usually speed of light
			is the time elapsed from the moment a bit is transmitted til the moment that bit is received.
	Random (deal with it in probability fashion)
		Processing Delay
		Queueing
Throughput: bps
