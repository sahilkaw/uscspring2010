demand exceeds supply = dropping packets
Overview pg65 = ee465 not in this course
	explains why packets are dropped
End to end delay = tranfser time
	random because one part of it is random (queueing and processing)
RTT: round trip time/ response time
	sometimes calculated from the end of the transmission msg
	sometimes calculates as the sum of the forward and backward propogation time.

Throughput = 	length of message (bits) / RTT
bit (delay) rate = 	length of message (bits) / Transmission time
Bandwith = units in Hz
Bit rate = units in bps
bandwidth and values are about the same except units are different
Capacity = amount you can transfer reliably
1 byte = 8 bits
Pipe size = bandwidth x delay

Layered architecture
protocol: a set of communications between entities for the purpose of timely delivered presentation.
Order of protocol must be very clear.
Standard: allowing all manufacturers to develop something to all standards.
	  Takes too long for somehting to be standarized.

Memorize 7 layers of OSI
Network related layers = 1-3
SAP: Service access points

NH = network header
	source ip adress
	destination ip adress 
Packet = NH + data (layer 3 - network)
Frame = DLH + packet + Data link trailer (layer 2 - data link)
MAC = Media access control
RAW = no Structure
