What have I done: 
phase 1 - completed
phase 2 - completed
phase 3 - completed
70% is beejs.
30% is mines.

Code files:
Branch.c [Actually a .cpp file named .c]
	Creates 3 threads running this code each with its own unique id.
	Opens a branch#.txt where # is the id number.
	Stores car name and prices in a double array.
	Creates a TCP connection to the Database and sends the car name with price.
	Closes TCP connection to database.
	Creates a TCP connection and waits for a packet.
	When it receives a packet it checks if they have the car and sends to the sender the price.
	Closes TCP connection when 2 users/clients leave.
Database.c [Actually a .cpp file named .c]
	Creates a TCP connection waiting for multiple clients to connect to it.
	Saves the data car, price and branch number.
	Closes TCP connection when three Branches/clients disconnect from it.
	Creates a UDP socket and waits for a packet.
	When queried for a car, returns to user the branch id if the car exists in their database.
	Closes UDP socket when 2 users/clients  send "done" message.
User.c [Actually a .cpp file named .c]
	Creates a UDP socket to send messages to the database.
	Queries the database with a car and gets the branch id in response and saves the information.
	Closes UDP socket when done sending all queries.
	Create TCP connections with all 3 branches.
	Query specific branches about cars's price with a car name according to the information we just got from the UDP packet sending.
	Close TCP connections with all 3 branches.
makefile
	Call 'gmake' in the terminal and it builds the object files: Branch, Database, User

Run:
	Open 3 windows.
	window 1:
	gmake
	Database

	window 2:
	Branch

	window 3:
	User

Message Format:
	Phase 1:
		'id'				state branch id
		'carName-price'		car data
		'0'					acknowledgement
	Phase 2:
		'userid-carName'	user id and car name
		'branchid'			return branch id
	Phase 3:
		'UserId-carName'	car query
		'cost'				car price

Idiosyncrasy:
	Sometimes the IP isnt printed out; It appears as 0.0.0.0.
	But the program runs sending and receiving messages.

Reused Code:
	Like i mentioned before. Look for the beejs comments and my comments may be inside those.
	70% is beejs. 
	// beejs-start
	// beejs-end
	30% is mines.
	// mines-start
	// mines-end
